# CreateRemdDirs
Automatically generate input for running M-REMD simulations (and more) in Amber.

About CreateRemdDirs
====================
CreateRemdDirs can be used to automatically generate input for running REMD, 
H-REMD, M-REMD, and MD simulations that will be chained together (split up into
several runs). The general idea is to facilitate long simulation runs on e.g.
HPC resources.
